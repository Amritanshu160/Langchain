Spoken language combines vowel and consonant sounds to form units of meaning like words, which belong to a language's lexicon. There are many different intentional speech acts, such as informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing; acts may vary in various aspects like enunciation, intonation, loudness, and tempo to convey meaning. Individuals may also unintentionally communicate aspects of their social position through speech, such as sex, age, place of origin, physiological and mental condition, education, and experiences.\\n\\nWhile normally used to facilitate communication with others, people may also use speech without the intent to communicate. Speech may nevertheless express emotions or desires; people talk to themselves sometimes in acts that are a development of what some psychologists (e.g., Lev Vygotsky) have maintained is the use of silent speech in an interior monologue to vivify and organize cognition, sometimes in the momentary adoption of a dual persona as self\")]"

It\\nconsists of the features described in “IBM Communications Server for Data Center\\nDeployment on Linux” and “Advanced Networking Features” on page 5.\\nIBM Communications Server for Data Center Deployment on\\nLinux\\nIBM Communications Server for Data Center Deployment on Linux connects\\napplications across SNA and TCP/IP networks. It converts a Linux computer into\\nan SNA node by equipping it with SNA resources and protocols; this enables the\\nLinux computer to communicate with other computers in an SNA network,\\nincluding host computers. It also provides TCP/IP functions to allow IBM\\nCommunications Server for Data Center Deployment on Linux to be used within\\nyour TCP/IP network or at the boundary between TCP/IP and SNA networks.\\nCS Linux provides the following services:\\nNetwork Support\\nCS Linux supports subarea and peer-to-peer networks:\\nSNA Subarea Networks\\nThese networks (also known as host-mediated networks) are\\nhierarchically organized, with one or more host computers\\ncontrolling communication between computers, managing the\\nnetwork, and providing processing services and high-capacity data\\nstorage. All other nodes in the network are dependent on the\\ncontrol of a host.\\nLinux computers can participate in a subarea network by being\\nconfigured as host-dependent nodes.\\nPeer-to-Peer Networks\\nFor distributed processing environments, CS Linux supports APPN\\nnetworks. In these peer-to-peer networks, Linux computers retain\\nprocessing functions and communicate directly with each other as\\npeers. Peer-to-peer networks fully use the capability of the Linux\\ncomputer, which today rivals that of expensive host computers.\\nAn APPN network consists of peer nodes of the following types:\\nv APPN network node (which provides traffic control, dynamic\\nroute computation and selection services, and network\\nmanagement services)\\nv APPN end node (which uses APPN network node services to\\ncommunicate with peer nodes)\\n© Copyright IBM Corp. 2000, 2012 1'),\n",

(For a\\ndetailed list of the link types supported, see “Installation Requirements” on\\npage 17.) It supports data links for different network types, as follows:\\nLocal Area Networks\\nFor LAN connectivity, you can install the appropriate links to\\ncommunicate using token ring, standard Ethernet, and 802.3\\nEthernet protocols.\\nWide Area Networks\\nCS Linux supports SDLC and X.25 (QLLC) connectivity. This\\ndepends on the OEM adapter support on each platform.\\nLocal Attachment\\nCS Linux supports Channel-to-Channel Multipath Channel\\n(CTCMPC) connectivity for local attachment (CS Linux for System\\nz only).\\nIP Integration\\nIf your corporate backbone network is based on IP , you can use the\\nEnterprise Extender (HPR/IP) feature of CS Linux to integrate this\\nwith SNA, allowing your SNA applications to communicate over\\nthe IP network.\\nLU Support\\nLogical units (LUs) are application-specific network resources that reside\\non each node in an SNA network. Each LU acts as an interface that\\napplications use to access links in order to communicate over the network\\nwith partner applications on other nodes.\\nCS Linux supports different types of LUs for different classes of\\napplications.\\nv In a subarea network, CS Linux supports dependent LUs, which can be\\nany of the following types:\\n–L U 0\\n–L U 1\\n–L U 2\\n–L U 3\\n– LU 6.2\\nLU 0 supports primitive program-to-program communication, typically\\nused at point-of-sale transactions in retail and banking.

This\\nreduces the initial configuration required at the host, and makes later\\nexpansion easier.\\nCS Linux can communicate with both DDDLU-capable and\\nnon-DDDLU-capable hosts, with no difference in the configuration\\nrequired. When the communications link from the CS Linux node to the\\nhost is established, a DDDLU-capable host informs the node that it\\nsupports DDDLU; the node then sends the required information to\\ndefine the dependent LUs that use the link.

This function has some restrictions for\\nconnectivity, but allows applications to pass data between dependent LU\\ndevices without the need for a full mainframe application.\\nSession Support\\nA session is a temporary logical channel between partner LUs. Ordinarily,\\npartner applications associated with each LU communicate over the\\nsession. CS Linux can support thousands of sessions. CS Linux can also\\nsupport U-shaped sessions (also known as “local/remote transparency”), in\\nwhich both primary and secondary LUs reside in the same Linux\\ncomputer. This enables you to develop and test a pair of source and target\\ntransaction programs in one computer without requiring a link connection.\\nThe data flowing on a session between two partner LUs may be\\ncompressed, to reduce the bandwidth required.\\nv For LU type 6.2, CS Linux allows you to specify the use of compression\\nin the configuration of the mode that the session uses. You can specify\\ndifferent compression algorithms to be used, each of which provides a\\ndifferent level of compression (RLE, LZ9, or LZ10). You can also specify\\ndifferent compression levels for data flowing in different directions on\\nthe session, or specify compression in one direction but not the other.\\nv For LU types 0–3, CS Linux allows you to specify the use of\\ncompression in the configuration of the link station or PU that the\\nsession uses. RLE compression is used for the inbound direction, and\\nLZ9 for the outbound direction.\\nAPI Support\\nCS Linux includes application programming interfaces (APIs) for\\ndeveloping applications for certain types of LUs, for distributed processing,\\nfor network management, and for administration of CS Linux itself.

Nevertheless, by using the rule of thumb that LUs, active links, and\\nongoing sessions are the dominant consumers of computer resources, you can\\nestimate the amount of additional memory and disk space that is required to\\nsupport the most demanding applications.\\nMemory and Storage Requirements for Operation\\nThis section describes the memory and storage requirements of a workstation\\nrunning CS Linux.\\nKernel Memory\\nLinux uses kernel memory to enable communication between the\\ncommunication subsystems and the DLCs. The kernel memory is a shared\\nresource that must be managed at the system level. CS Linux uses kernel\\nmemory to send and receive data across the network, but it is just one of\\nthe subsystems that uses kernel memory. CS Linux's kernel memory\\nresource utilization can affect the performance of other subsystems, such as\\nTCP/IP or NFS. Coordinate with your network administrator in\\ndetermining kernel memory requirements.\\nMemory, Disk, and Paging Storage\\nCS Linux uses primary storage—also known as main memory and random\\naccess memory (RAM)—permanent disk storage, and paging disk storage\\n(also known as paging space):\\nv Control blocks for SNA resources—such as LUs, links, and\\nsessions—consume primary storage.\\nv Kernel memory consumes only primary storage.\\nv CS Linux executables, configuration files, and softcopy publications\\nconsume permanent disk storage.\\nv Application programs, sessions, and related processes have paging space\\nrequirements that consume permanent disk storage.\\nMemory and disk storage requirements depend on various factors that\\nwidely differ from one environment to another. Transaction programs (TPs)\\nand SNA sessions are the dominant consumers of memory and disk\\nstorage.\\nA TP is a program that uses the SNA application programming interface\\n(API) to access the network. A session is a temporary logical channel\\nbetween two LUs on partner nodes. TPs use this channel to communicate\\nwith each other.\\nThe consumption of memory and disk storage is largely affected by the\\noverall number of sessions, the number of allocated sessions\\n(conversations), the traffic intensity of the conversations, and the number\\nof active user TPs.

An idle session is an active session that is not being used\\nby TPs. An allocated session is one that supports an ongoing conversation.\\nTo estimate the total memory requirement, you need to estimate the traffic\\nintensity and the portion of the overall number of sessions that will be\\nallocated, on average, at any one time.

If CS Linux uses IPv6, TN Clients can use either IPv6 or\\nIPv4. By default the TN Server accepts connections from both types of clients,\\nbut you can configure it to listen on a particular IP address (using the\\nlisten_local_addressparameter in the command-line administration program or a\\nNOF application) in order to restrict it to one type of client connection.\\nv For TN Redirector, if CS Linux uses IPv4, both TCP/IP connections (from the\\nclient to CS Linux and from CS Linux to the host) must also use IPv4.\\nIf CS Linux uses IPv6, the TCP/IP connection from the client to CS Linux\\nfollows the same rules as for TN Server. The connection from CS Linux to the\\nhost can use either IPv6 or IPv4. There is no requirement for the two\\nconnections to use the same addressing format.\\nv For Enterprise Extender (HPR/IP), the ports at both ends of a link must use the\\nsame addressing format (IPv4 or IPv6).\\n– If CS Linux uses IPv4, it can connect only to remote systems that are\\nconfigured to support IPv4.\\n– If CS Linux uses IPv6, you can configure it to use either IPv4 or IPv6 on an\\nEnterprise Extender link.

The simplest\\nway to manage these is to set them in a text file that CS Linux reads on startup.\\nIn the CS Linux configuration directory, /etc/opt/ibm/sna, create a text file named\\nenvironment, and set each environment variable in a separate line. For example:\\nexport LANG=en_US\\nexport PATH=”$PATH:/opt/ibm/sna/bin”\\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/opt/ibm/sna/lib\\nexport LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/lib:/opt/ibm/sna/lib\\nIf you are running 64-bit applications, change the environment variables as below:\\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64:/opt/ibm/sna/lib64\\nexport LD_RUN_PATH=/usr/lib64:/opt/ibm/sna/lib64\\nUsing the Motif Administration Program\\nBefore you use the Motif administration program, you may want to add path\\ninformation to your.login or .profile file to enable the system to find executable\\nprograms (see “Specifying the Path to CS Linux Programs”). In addition, you must\\nenable the CS Linux software before you can use the administration program (see\\n“Enabling CS Linux” on page 68).\\nFor information about invoking the Motif administration program and an overview\\nof using the program, see “Managing CS Linux with the Motif Administration\\nProgram” on page 68.\\nSpecifying the Path to CS Linux Programs\\nTo run CS Linux programs, you must specify the path to the directory that\\ncontains the CS Linux executable programs. You can specify the path either by\\nadding the directory to yourPATH environment variable before you run the\\nprograms for the first time, or by including the directory name each time you run\\nthe programs.\\nThe Motif administration program is stored in the directory /opt/ibm/sna/bin/X11,\\nand the other programs are stored in the directory /opt/ibm/sna/bin. If you add\\nthese directories to the definition of the PATH environment variable in your .login\\nor .profile file, CS Linux locates the programs automatically.

This happens if none of the servers in the\\nconfiguration server list can be contacted. If this happens, you can view and\\nconfigure node resources only on the servers that can be contacted.\\nNote: You cannot directly indicate which node acts as the master server; the\\nmaster server is selected based on the order in which nodes are added to the\\nconfiguration server list. If you wish to move a server to the top of the list,\\nremove all other nodes from the list and then add them again.\\nIn the Motif administration program Domain window, you can add a configuration\\nserver by selecting Make configuration server from the Selection menu. The\\nserver is added to the end of the list; it becomes the master server only if all other\\nconfiguration servers are unavailable. To remove a server, selectRemove\\nconfiguration server from the Selection menu.\\nNote: You cannot delete a server if it is the only server listed on which the CS\\nLinux software is running, because in this case there is no other server that\\ncan take over as the master server.

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

About IBM Communications Server for Data Center\\nDeployment on Linux\\nThis chapter explains how CS Linux is packaged and describes its functions,\\nfeatures, and benefits.\\nIBM Communications Server for Data Center Deployment on Linux\\nFeatures and Packaging\\nCS Linux is communication software that runs on the Linux operating system. It\\nconsists of the features described in “IBM Communications Server for Data Center\\nDeployment on Linux” and “Advanced Networking Features” on page 5.\\nIBM Communications Server for Data Center Deployment on\\nLinux\\nIBM Communications Server for Data Center Deployment on Linux connects\\napplications across SNA and TCP/IP networks. It converts a Linux computer into\\nan SNA node by equipping it with SNA resources and protocols; this enables the\\nLinux computer to communicate with other computers in an SNA network,\\nincluding host computers. It also provides TCP/IP functions to allow IBM\\nCommunications Server for Data Center Deployment on Linux to be used within\\nyour TCP/IP network or at the boundary between TCP/IP and SNA networks.\\nCS Linux provides the following services:\\nNetwork Support\\nCS Linux supports subarea and peer-to-peer networks:\\nSNA Subarea Networks\\nThese networks (also known as host-mediated networks) are\\nhierarchically organized, with one or more host computers\\ncontrolling communication between computers, managing the\\nnetwork, and providing processing services and high-capacity data\\nstorage. All other nodes in the network are dependent on the\\ncontrol of a host.\\nLinux computers can participate in a subarea network by being\\nconfigured as host-dependent nodes.\\nPeer-to-Peer Networks\\nFor distributed processing environments, CS Linux supports APPN\\nnetworks. In these peer-to-peer networks, Linux computers retain\\nprocessing functions and communicate directly with each other as\\npeers. Peer-to-peer networks fully use the capability of the Linux\\ncomputer, which today rivals that of expensive host computers.\\nAn APPN network consists of peer nodes of the following types:\\nv APPN network node (which provides traffic control, dynamic\\nroute computation and selection services, and network\\nmanagement services)\\nv APPN end node (which uses APPN network node services to\\ncommunicate with peer nodes)\\n© Copyright IBM Corp. 2000, 2012 1'),\n",

(For a\\ndetailed list of the link types supported, see “Installation Requirements” on\\npage 17.) It supports data links for different network types, as follows:\\nLocal Area Networks\\nFor LAN connectivity, you can install the appropriate links to\\ncommunicate using token ring, standard Ethernet, and 802.3\\nEthernet protocols.\\nWide Area Networks\\nCS Linux supports SDLC and X.25 (QLLC) connectivity. This\\ndepends on the OEM adapter support on each platform.\\nLocal Attachment\\nCS Linux supports Channel-to-Channel Multipath Channel\\n(CTCMPC) connectivity for local attachment (CS Linux for System\\nz only).\\nIP Integration\\nIf your corporate backbone network is based on IP , you can use the\\nEnterprise Extender (HPR/IP) feature of CS Linux to integrate this\\nwith SNA, allowing your SNA applications to communicate over\\nthe IP network.\\nLU Support\\nLogical units (LUs) are application-specific network resources that reside\\non each node in an SNA network. Each LU acts as an interface that\\napplications use to access links in order to communicate over the network\\nwith partner applications on other nodes.\\nCS Linux supports different types of LUs for different classes of\\napplications.\\nv In a subarea network, CS Linux supports dependent LUs, which can be\\nany of the following types:\\n–L U 0\\n–L U 1\\n–L U 2\\n–L U 3\\n– LU 6.2\\nLU 0 supports primitive program-to-program communication, typically\\nused at point-of-sale transactions in retail and banking.

This\\nreduces the initial configuration required at the host, and makes later\\nexpansion easier.\\nCS Linux can communicate with both DDDLU-capable and\\nnon-DDDLU-capable hosts, with no difference in the configuration\\nrequired. When the communications link from the CS Linux node to the\\nhost is established, a DDDLU-capable host informs the node that it\\nsupports DDDLU; the node then sends the required information to\\ndefine the dependent LUs that use the link. If the host is not\\nDDDLU-capable, CS Linux does not send this information; it assumes\\nthat the LUs have already been defined statically at the host.\\nv Independent LU 6.2 supports independent traffic in APPN networks.\\nIndependent LU 6.2 supports autonomous communication and network\\nmanagement, as well as distributed processing.\\nIn addition, the DLUR function of CS Linux enables traffic from\\ndependent LUs to travel over an APPN network.\\nv Primary RUI support provides the ability for a CS Linux application to\\nmanage downstream LAN/WAN attached dependent LU devices as\\nthough it were a mainframe. This function has some restrictions for\\nconnectivity, but allows applications to pass data between dependent LU\\ndevices without the need for a full mainframe application.\\nSession Support\\nA session is a temporary logical channel between partner LUs. Ordinarily,\\npartner applications associated with each LU communicate over the\\nsession. CS Linux can support thousands of sessions. CS Linux can also\\nsupport U-shaped sessions (also known as “local/remote transparency”), in\\nwhich both primary and secondary LUs reside in the same Linux\\ncomputer. This enables you to develop and test a pair of source and target\\ntransaction programs in one computer without requiring a link connection.\\nThe data flowing on a session between two partner LUs may be\\ncompressed, to reduce the bandwidth required.\\nv For LU type 6.2, CS Linux allows you to specify the use of compression\\nin the configuration of the mode that the session uses. You can specify\\ndifferent compression algorithms to be used, each of which provides a\\ndifferent level of compression (RLE, LZ9, or LZ10). You can also specify\\ndifferent compression levels for data flowing in different directions on\\nthe session, or specify compression in one direction but not the other.\\nv For LU types 0–3, CS Linux allows you to specify the use of\\ncompression in the configuration of the link station or PU that the\\nsession uses. RLE compression is used for the inbound direction, and\\nLZ9 for the outbound direction.\\nAPI Support\\nCS Linux includes application programming interfaces (APIs) for\\ndeveloping applications for certain types of LUs, for distributed processing,\\nfor network management, and for administration of CS Linux itself.

It consists of a library of verbs (also\\ncalled functions, calls, and subroutines) from which the TP selects those it\\nneeds to pass to its LU to request an action, such as SEND_DATA.

Nevertheless, by using the rule of thumb that LUs, active links, and\\nongoing sessions are the dominant consumers of computer resources, you can\\nestimate the amount of additional memory and disk space that is required to\\nsupport the most demanding applications.\\nMemory and Storage Requirements for Operation\\nThis section describes the memory and storage requirements of a workstation\\nrunning CS Linux.\\nKernel Memory\\nLinux uses kernel memory to enable communication between the\\ncommunication subsystems and the DLCs. The kernel memory is a shared\\nresource that must be managed at the system level. CS Linux uses kernel\\nmemory to send and receive data across the network, but it is just one of\\nthe subsystems that uses kernel memory. CS Linux's kernel memory\\nresource utilization can affect the performance of other subsystems, such as\\nTCP/IP or NFS. Coordinate with your network administrator in\\ndetermining kernel memory requirements.\\nMemory, Disk, and Paging Storage\\nCS Linux uses primary storage—also known as main memory and random\\naccess memory (RAM)—permanent disk storage, and paging disk storage\\n(also known as paging space):\\nv Control blocks for SNA resources—such as LUs, links, and\\nsessions—consume primary storage.\\nv Kernel memory consumes only primary storage.\\nv CS Linux executables, configuration files, and softcopy publications\\nconsume permanent disk storage.\\nv Application programs, sessions, and related processes have paging space\\nrequirements that consume permanent disk storage.\\nMemory and disk storage requirements depend on various factors that\\nwidely differ from one environment to another. Transaction programs (TPs)\\nand SNA sessions are the dominant consumers of memory and disk\\nstorage.\\nA TP is a program that uses the SNA application programming interface\\n(API) to access the network. A session is a temporary logical channel\\nbetween two LUs on partner nodes. TPs use this channel to communicate\\nwith each other.\\nThe consumption of memory and disk storage is largely affected by the\\noverall number of sessions, the number of allocated sessions\\n(conversations), the traffic intensity of the conversations, and the number\\nof active user TPs. Memory requirements are mostly affected by the\\nStages of Network Planning\\n20 IBM Communications Server for Data Center Deployment on Linux for Quick Beginnings\"),\n",

Disk\\nstorage requirements stem from the paging space requirements of the TPs,\\nsessions, and related processes.\\nFor all LU types, a distinction is made between an idle session and an\\nallocated session. An idle session is an active session that is not being used\\nby TPs. An allocated session is one that supports an ongoing conversation.\\nTo estimate the total memory requirement, you need to estimate the traffic\\nintensity and the portion of the overall number of sessions that will be\\nallocated, on average, at any one time. You can also choose to configure the\\nsystem to handle peak demand. These estimates vary among\\nenvironments.\\nIf you increase the session load beyond system memory capacity, you incur\\nthe cost of paging.\\nProcesses\\nCS Linux requires a minimum of 20 Linux processes.\\nIPv4 and IPv6 Addressing\\nComputers running CS Linux Version 7.0 can use either IPv4 or IPv6 addresses,\\nwith the following constraints.\\nv All servers in a Client/Server domain must use the same addressing format\\n(IPv4 or IPv6).\\n– If the servers use IPv4, clients must also use IPv4.\\n– If the servers use IPv6, clients can use either IPv6 or IPv4.\\nv For TN Server, if CS Linux uses IPv4, TN clients connecting to the TN Server\\nmust also use IPv4. If CS Linux uses IPv6, TN Clients can use either IPv6 or\\nIPv4. By default the TN Server accepts connections from both types of clients,\\nbut you can configure it to listen on a particular IP address (using the\\nlisten_local_addressparameter in the command-line administration program or a\\nNOF application) in order to restrict it to one type of client connection.\\nv For TN Redirector, if CS Linux uses IPv4, both TCP/IP connections (from the\\nclient to CS Linux and from CS Linux to the host) must also use IPv4.\\nIf CS Linux uses IPv6, the TCP/IP connection from the client to CS Linux\\nfollows the same rules as for TN Server. The connection from CS Linux to the\\nhost can use either IPv6 or IPv4. There is no requirement for the two\\nconnections to use the same addressing format.\\nv For Enterprise Extender (HPR/IP), the ports at both ends of a link must use the\\nsame addressing format (IPv4 or IPv6).\\n– If CS Linux uses IPv4, it can connect only to remote systems that are\\nconfigured to support IPv4.\\n– If CS Linux uses IPv6, you can configure it to use either IPv4 or IPv6 on an\\nEnterprise Extender link. The option you choose must match the\\nconfiguration at the remote system.\\nIn addition, all links on the same Enterprise Extender port must use the same\\naddressing format (IPv4 or IPv6). If you need to support links with different\\naddressing formats, you must use separate ports. Similarly, all Enterprise\\nExtender ports on the same connection network must use the same addressing\\nformat.\\nTo check whether a CS Linux server is running IPv4 or IPv6, use the command\\nifconfig -a and look at the IP address or addresses in the output.

You can also use other administration tools such as command-line\\nadministration, but the Motif program is recommended.\\nThe Motif administration program includes help screens that provide overview\\ninformation for SNA and CS Linux, reference information for CS Linux dialogs,\\nand guidance for performing specific tasks. For each task (such as configuring the\\nnode) or type of communications (such as TN3270 or APPC), the program guides\\nyou in setting up the configuration of the required resources.\\nThe Motif administration program enables you to set up all required parameters\\nfor standard CS Linux configurations. For advanced parameters, the Motif\\nadministration program supplies default values. You need to supply only the\\nessential configuration information, which enables you to set up SNA\\ncommunications quickly and easily.\\nYou can also use the Motif administration program to manage the running CS\\nLinux system. The administration program enables you to make and apply changes\\nto the configuration while CS Linux is active, and provides easy access to status\\ninformation for node resources.\\nThe Motif administration program automatically displays status information for CS\\nLinux resources. Most of this information is shown on the Node window (see\\n“Managing CS Linux with the Motif Administration Program” on page 68). In\\naddition, you can control certain resources—such as nodes and link stations—using\\ntheStart and Stop buttons on the Node window.

If this happens, you can view and\\nconfigure node resources only on the servers that can be contacted.\\nNote: You cannot directly indicate which node acts as the master server; the\\nmaster server is selected based on the order in which nodes are added to the\\nconfiguration server list. If you wish to move a server to the top of the list,\\nremove all other nodes from the list and then add them again.\\nIn the Motif administration program Domain window, you can add a configuration\\nserver by selecting Make configuration server from the Selection menu. The\\nserver is added to the end of the list; it becomes the master server only if all other\\nconfiguration servers are unavailable. To remove a server, selectRemove\\nconfiguration server from the Selection menu.\\nNote: You cannot delete a server if it is the only server listed on which the CS\\nLinux software is running, because in this case there is no other server that\\ncan take over as the master server.

For example, you can define several\\n3270 LUs in a single LU pool, then configure multiple TN3270 clients using this LU\\npool. This makes configuring the 3270 sessions easier and enables any client to use\\nany LU in the pool.\\nNote: You can assign a TN3270 client either to a specific LU or to an LU pool.\\nv If you assign the client to a specific LU that is in a pool, the client uses\\nthis LU if it is available; otherwise it uses any free LU from the pool, as\\nthough you had assigned it to the LU pool instead of the specific LU.\\nv If you want the client to use only a specified LU, so that the client's\\nsession cannot be established if the LU is already in use, ensure that the\\nLU is not in a pool.\\nYou can view the LU pools for the local CS Linux node using the LU Pools\\nwindow. This window lists the LU pools configured on the local system, and\\nenables you to select LUs to add to an LU pool.\\nYou can add the following LU types to a pool for use by 3270 (do not mix LUs of\\ndifferent types in the same pool):\\nv 3270 display LU\\nv Unrestricted LU\\nBefore you can add LUs to a pool, the LUs must be defined on the local node.\\nTo configure an LU pool, perform the following steps from the Node window:\\n1.

This allows you\\nto use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security checking where necessary, and not on\\nthe complete user-to-host connection. For example:\\nv If clients are connecting to CS Linux over a TCP/IP LAN where checking is not\\nrequired, but are connecting to a remote host that requires SSL, you can use SSL\\nover the TCP/IP connection between CS Linux and the host. This means that\\nsecurity is checked once for all clients, and individual clients do not have to\\nprovide security information.\\nv If CS Linux is installed on the same site as the host, but clients are connecting in\\nfrom external sites, you can use SSL over the client connections to CS Linux\\nwithout having to install SSL software on the host.\\nConfiguring TN Redirector\\nBefore you can configure TN Redirector access, you must define the local node as\\ndescribed in “Configuring the Node” on page 74. You also need the following\\ninformation:\\nv If only certain clients are permitted, you need the TCP/IP name or address of\\nthe client.\\nv TCP/IP port number used by the client to connect to the TN Redirector node.\\nv TCP/IP name or address of the host.\\nv TCP/IP port number used by the TN Redirector node to connect to the host.\\nv Whether SSL data encryption, client authentication, and server authentication are\\nrequired between the client and the TN Redirector node (this option is available\\nonly if you have installed the additional software required to support it).\\nv Whether SSL data encryption is required between the TN Redirector node and\\nthe host.\\nThe TN redirector defaults record defines parameters that are used on all TN\\nredirector client sessions.

These\\nmodules are loaded when you first enable the CS Linux software, and are\\nunloaded only when you change the kernel run level.\\nCS Linux also requires a number of daemons (programs) to be running. Until these\\ndaemons are running, you cannot configure or use CS Linux.\\nv To start the daemons and enable the CS Linux software, issue the command sna\\nstart.\\nv To stop the daemons and disable the CS Linux software, issue the command sna\\nstop.\\nInitializing the SNA node\\nWhen the CS Linux software has been enabled, you can configure the SNA node\\nand its resources, typically using the Motif administration program xsnaadmin.\\nHowever, the node is not available for use until it is initialized. You can initialize it\\nfrom the command-line administration program, using the commandsnaadmin\\ninit_node, or from the Motif administration program xsnaadmin.\\nActivating ports and link stations\\nPorts and link stations can be configured to start in different circumstances:\\nv By operator intervention only\\nv On demand (when an application starts that uses a resource on the link)\\nv On node start-up (when the command snaadmin init_node is issued, or when\\nthe node is started from the Motif administration program).\\nStarting by operator is the default, but you can change this for a particular port or\\nlink by using the command-line administration program or the Motif\\nadministration program.\\nNote: Starting a port enables that port to receive calls from other computers, but\\ndoes not allow it to make outgoing calls. Starting a link station means that\\nCS Linux attempts to contact the remote computer.\\nStarting CS Linux at reboot time\\nIn common with other Linux services, CS Linux is enabled at reboot. In other\\nwords, by default after a reboot, the commandsna start is issued but the SNA\\nnode is not started.\\nThis initialization is done in the CS Linux boot time initialization script,\\n/etc/rc.d/init.d/snastart. As is conventional for start-up scripts, this is linked to\\n/etc/rc?.d/init.d/snastart for the various boot levels.\\nYou can edit /etc/rc.d/init.d/snastart to change what happens at reboot. The most\\ncommon change is to add the initialization of the node. The command for this,\\nsnaadmin init_node, is already included in the file but commented out, so you\\nsimply need to uncomment it. By including this command, you also trigger the\\nactivation of any ports or link stations that are configured to be activated on node\\nstart-up.\\nStarting CS Linux Automatically\\nChapter 8.

Spoken language combines vowel and consonant sounds to form units of meaning like words, which belong to a language's lexicon. There are many different intentional speech acts, such as informing, declaring, asking, persuading, directing; acts may vary in various aspects like enunciation, intonation, loudness, and tempo to convey meaning. Individuals may also unintentionally communicate aspects of their social position through speech, such as sex, age, place of origin, physiological and mental condition, education, and experiences.\"),\n",
